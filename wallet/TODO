-Add new functionality to the wallet:
    -initiate transaction
    -accept transaction --- (maybe?)
    -sign & verify
    -storage for assets --- (maybe the database with different folder)
        -file name: asset name
        -file content: asset bytes

-Add Transaction type instead of string in Block.meta_data

-Should I add money to variable to Wallet, to hold amount?
