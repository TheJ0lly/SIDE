-Add new functionality to the wallet:
    -initiate transaction
    -accept transaction --- (maybe?) - Maybe not needed, because if the transaction is verified and initiated it just executes?
    -sign & verify


-Add Transaction type instead of string in Block.meta_data

-Should I add money to variable to Wallet, to hold amount?
