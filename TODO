Mandatory:
    -Add Wallets (Users)
    
    -Add a CLI package to handle and beautify the CLI, of course :)

After-thought:
    -Add serialize/deserialize mechanism for database
    
    -Add lookup for data - good for searching through whole blockchain, research how to do it, maybe do a 2-ended search using go-routines, one from start to middle, one from middle to end, let's see :)
    
    -Add way to add & remove & manage users to the network
        -Research how to synchronize the database for new users.
    
    -Add new things required for a blockchain
