Mandatory:
    -Add a CLI package to handle and beautify the CLI, of course :)

    Research Hash Tree / Merkle Tree

After-thought:    
    -Add lookup for data - good for searching through whole blockchain, research how to do it, maybe do a 2-ended search using go-routines, one from start to middle, one from middle to end, let's see :)
    
    -Add way to add & remove & manage users to the network
        -Research how to synchronize the database for new users.
    
    -Add new things required for a blockchain.

    -Maybe smart-contracts? 

After meeting 13.09.2023:
    -change CLI to CLI with flags
    -hash trees/Merkle trees for block data storage
        -Redo storage of data
        -Redo hash function for blocks

        
    -Hyper Ledger?
    -More research for bc
    -New ideas to add?
